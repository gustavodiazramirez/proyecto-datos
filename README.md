## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Setup

It can be helpful to have a dedicated environment for development. Here
we are assuming that you have an conda environment file called `env.yml`
named after `Gustavo` i.e.:

``` yaml
# env.yml
name: Gustavo

channels:
  - fastai

dependencies:
  - fastai::nbdev>=2.3.12
# - python>=3.11  # specify python version if required 
# - dependency 1
# - dependency 2
# - pip
# pip:
#   - pip dependency 1
#   - pip dependency 2
```

You can then use `conda` or `mamba` (faster at resolving) to create and
update your environment file should your needs change as you work on
`Gustavo`

``` sh
# create a conda environment for working on Gustavo
$ mamba env create -f env.yml

# update conda environment
$ mamba env update -n Gustavo --file env.yml
```

### Install Gustavo in Development mode

``` sh
# activate conda environment
$ conda activate Gustavo

# make sure Gustavo package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to Gustavo
$ nbdev_prepare
```
